Heuristic Dropout: An Efficient Regularization Method for Medical Image Segmentation Models
Official implementation of Heuristic Dropout: An Efficient Regularization Method for Medical Image Segmentation Models.

Usage 
This repository contains the MindSpore implementation of the Heuristic Dropout method, which was originally proposed as an efficient regularization technique for medical image segmentation models. 
the original paper provide an out-of-the-box implementation of the proposed Heuristic Dropout. To use the Heuristic Dropout, simply replace the original in your medical image segmentation models with it
