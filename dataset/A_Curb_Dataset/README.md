# A Curb Dataset with LiDAR Data for Autonomous Driving

This is a dataset with curb annotations by using 3D LiDAR data and we build this dataset based on the SemanticKITTI dataset.

## File format

The file format follows with that of the SemanticKITTI dataset, but in a 2D coordinate frame. \
For example, the data in './dataset/sequences/00/curb/000000.txt' represents the curb points in a 2D bird's eye view corresponding to the LiDAR point cloud of frame 000000, sequence 00. The curb data of this frame has a dimension of N*3: N means the number of curb point clouds and 3 means (x, y, curb_instance_id). \
We labeled the LiDAR data in sequences 00-10, totaling 23201 frames.

## Download

The dataset is available at [mindspore](https://download.mindspore.cn/dataset/).

## How to use

The dataset is easy to be downloaded and parsed with a provided Python script to visualize the curb data.

```python
python vis_data.py -c ${curb_dataset_folder_path}/dataset/sequences/00
```

Moreover, if you want to get the raw point clouds data, you could go to the website of SemanticKITTI and visualize the point clouds with the curb data.

```python
python vis_data.py -c ${curb_dataset_folder_path}/dataset/sequences/00 -d ${SemanticKITTI_folder_path}/dataset/sequences/00
```
