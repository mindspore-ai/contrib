# Sketch2art-mindspore
The mindspore implementation of the paper: [Sketch-to-Art: Synthesizing Stylized Art Images From Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12888)

This repo only provides the three proposed modules in the paper: DMI, FMT, and IDN.
These are plug-and-play modules that can be applied to general Pix2Pix model for 
sketch-to-image synthesis tasks.

Here is an qualitative result from the sketch2art model:
